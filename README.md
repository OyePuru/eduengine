# eduengine
A knowledge base with optimized search engine which filters out content which is relevant for education only.

1. Team Name -> Offensive Coders

2. Theme -> Theme 1 ( A Search engine for educational purpose )

3. How will you solve the problem?
-> As everyone says, technology made learning easy as there are lots of websites that share different knowledge. So, to solve this problem, our team Offensive Coders are here to build the website 'www.eduengine.com' where students can choose the best resource and study focusively without distractions of suggestions.
We will be making a website with the entire focus on educational purpose. Where students can look for available resources present in eduengine knowledge base and they can upvote and downvote resources for other students. A student will be able to save some resources for the future purpose.
We will be making a database to store the number of resources, even users will also be able to add articles and resources.
Just in case if a resource isn't available in our knowledge base we will be using the google search engine but it will be enhanced and filtered for educational purpose. So after they find their solution they will be adding the content in our knowledge base as contribution towards the community like we are doing by providing this platform.

4. What will be your final demo?
-> Our final working solution will be a website which will be a knowledge base. We took references from learnawesome.org and geeksforgeeks.org. Now we are building a solution that uses a knowledge base and a customized search engine. If the related content isn't present we can show him results by using a customized search engine which is enhanced by the google search engine which is restricted to particular sites which are only for educational purposes. A user will be able to contribute a resource if they find something relevant from the enhanced search engine. Knowledge is incomplete without revision, So they can save the resources for later. We students have an idea about the highs and lows of the resources provided. So they will also be able to change the sequence in the list provided by upvoting and downvoting the article. This will help other students with the relevancy of the resource.
The focus of the EduEngine is keeping everything relevant on point to the education and so they can focus more.

Thankyou
